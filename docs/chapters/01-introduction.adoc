== Introduction

The {project-name} is a comprehensive, automated solution for load testing Azure Local (Azure Stack HCI) clusters. It validates storage, network, and compute performance before production or development workloads are migrated or deployed.

=== Why Load Test Azure Local?

Azure Local clusters represent significant infrastructure investments. Before committing production workloads, organizations need confidence that:

* **Storage performance** meets application IOPS, throughput, and latency requirements
* **Network throughput** supports east-west traffic, RDMA/SMB Direct expectations
* **Compute capacity** handles expected virtual machine density
* **The cluster** operates stably under sustained load without thermal throttling or hardware degradation
