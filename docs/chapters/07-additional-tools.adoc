== Additional Load Testing Tools

Beyond VMFleet, this framework supports additional tools for comprehensive cluster validation. Each tool targets a specific performance dimension.

=== fio (Flexible I/O Tester)

==== Purpose

Fine-grained storage I/O benchmarking with extensive control over workload parameters. Runs inside Linux VMs on the cluster.

==== Status

🔲 *Placeholder* — Structure and Ansible roles scaffolded; implementation pending.

==== When to Use

* Need precise control over I/O patterns beyond VMFleet's profiles
* Testing Linux VM storage performance specifically
* Validating I/O scheduler behavior, queue depths, or specific block sizes
* Client/server mode for distributed I/O testing

==== Key Capabilities

* Job file-based workload definition
* Multiple I/O engines (libaio, io_uring, Windows IOCP)
* JSON output for automated parsing
* Verification mode for data integrity testing

==== Location

* Scripts: `src/solutions/fio/scripts/`
* Ansible playbooks: `src/solutions/fio/playbooks/`
* Job files: `src/solutions/fio/job-files/`
* Profiles: `config/profiles/fio/`

=== iPerf3

==== Purpose

Network bandwidth, jitter, and packet loss measurement between cluster nodes and VMs.

==== Status

🔲 *Placeholder* — Structure and Ansible roles scaffolded; implementation pending.

==== When to Use

* Validating RDMA/SMB Direct network paths between cluster nodes
* Measuring east-west bandwidth between VMs
* Testing Switch Embedded Teaming (SET) throughput
* Baseline network performance before deploying workloads

==== Key Capabilities

* TCP, UDP, and SCTP protocol support
* Multi-stream parallel connections
* JSON output for automated parsing
* Server daemon mode for persistent testing endpoints

==== Location

* Scripts: `src/solutions/iperf/scripts/`
* Ansible playbooks: `src/solutions/iperf/playbooks/`
* Profiles: `config/profiles/iperf/`

=== HammerDB

==== Purpose

Database workload benchmarking for SQL Server running on Azure Local VMs.

==== Status

🔲 *Placeholder* — Structure and Ansible roles scaffolded; implementation pending.

==== When to Use

* Validating SQL Server performance on the cluster
* OLTP (TPROC-C) workload benchmarking
* OLAP/analytics (TPROC-H) workload benchmarking
* Combined storage + compute performance validation

==== Key Capabilities

* Supports SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and more
* TPC-C and TPC-H benchmark profiles
* GUI, CLI, and web interfaces
* Docker images for reproducible CI/CD runs

==== Location

* Scripts: `src/solutions/hammerdb/scripts/`
* Ansible playbooks: `src/solutions/hammerdb/playbooks/`
* Profiles: `config/profiles/hammerdb/`

=== stress-ng

==== Purpose

CPU, memory, cache, and system stress testing for capacity planning and burn-in validation.

==== Status

🔲 *Placeholder* — Structure and Ansible roles scaffolded; implementation pending.

==== When to Use

* CPU stress testing for thermal and power validation
* Memory stress testing for stability under pressure
* Burn-in testing of new cluster nodes
* Capacity planning — determine maximum safe utilization levels

==== Key Capabilities

* 370+ stress tests across CPU, memory, filesystem, network categories
* YAML job files for reproducible configurations
* Metrics: bogo ops/s, thermal zones, power measurement
* Stressor class system for targeted testing

==== Location

* Scripts: `src/solutions/stress-ng/scripts/`
* Ansible playbooks: `src/solutions/stress-ng/playbooks/`
* Profiles: `config/profiles/stress-ng/`
